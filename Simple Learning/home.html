We have always dreamed about doing something bigger than ourselves and this is the first step in the right direction. I always love to play and interact with kids, fascinated by the sheer amount of curiosity their little brains can hold. My selection of challenge courses taken over the last few years will help lead my  students to have a better grasp on concepts they need to learn to excel in school.</h2>

I understand how frustrating learning certain subjects are and I want to be there for your child through their learning journey. A little bit about me, I am currently going into AP Calculus and AP Literature. In my free time I like to play basketball and spend time with my family and friends.</h2>
