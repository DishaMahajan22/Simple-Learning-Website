# Simple-Learning-Website
I created a website using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL using a UI design I personally made. Through this project I furthered my knowledge about how a database works, as well as how to create a html form and have the data from the form be updated into my database. In the future I would like to not only add data to the database, but also export it into an Excel file.
